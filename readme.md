scrollview made for displaying flash cards with a front/back. 

the fun part is the memory management, only the cards on either side of the currently visible card are loaded into memory.

this is pretty useless if you can target ios6+, collection views can be made todo the same thing. this was made to target ios5, thus no autolayout support.

the code needs some clean up before it can be easily used in another project.
